# Sams-portfolio

This is a initial version of what will become my portfolio of work for professional use and for the UCB Coding Bootcamp. 

At the moment, since I have no actual projects up and running, I have used mock websites that I have thought up of. The four projects listed are:

## Features

- The main function of this is to show my work to potential clients or employers
- It has all my social media information on it
- It you can clink on the links in the navbar they will take you to different sections of the webpage

The link to the deployed github pages is [here](https://sam-levin.github.io/Sams-portfolio/)

I hope you enjoy!
